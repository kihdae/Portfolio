  bio: "Hello, My name is Emilio but you can call me Milo. I am a intrinsical full stack developer with a passion for technological advances and creations. I started my joruney in software development in 2020, during covid. Dreaded by boredom and burnout from video games, I decided to place my time elsewhere. From watching Harvard's CS50 to mentoring under a 25+ yr systems architect, I am a proud to have guided myself in this direction. We are at the forefront of a new era of technology and I am excited to be a part of it.",
